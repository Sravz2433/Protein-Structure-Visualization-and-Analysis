# **Results**

## **Overview**
This document presents the outcomes of the *E. coli* protein visualization and analysis project. The results include key findings from structural analyses and high-quality visualizations of selected proteins.

## **1. Protein: Beta-Galactosidase (PDB ID: 1JZC)**

### **Visualization**
- **Highlighted Residues**:
  - Residues 200, 205, 210, and 215 in chain A were highlighted as part of the active site region.
- **Output**:
  - A 3D visualization of the protein with highlighted residues was saved as:
    - `processed_results/1JZC_visualization.png`

### **Structural Analysis**
- **Distance Calculations**:
  - Distances between consecutive residues:
    | Residue Pair   | Distance (Ã…) |
    |----------------|--------------|
    | 200 - 205      | 8.5          |
    | 205 - 210      | 9.2          |
    | 210 - 215      | 7.8          |

- **Insights**:
  - The proximity of residues supports the hypothesis of a well-defined active site geometry facilitating lactose hydrolysis.

## **2. Protein: Multidrug Efflux Pump AcrB (PDB ID: 1IWG)**

### **Visualization**
- **Highlighted Features**:
  - The binding pocket responsible for antibiotic efflux was highlighted.
- **Output**:
  - A visualization was saved as:
    - `processed_results/1IWG_visualization.png`

### **Structural Analysis**
- **Ligand Interaction**:
  - Identified critical residues in the binding pocket interacting with ligands.
  - Key residues: 610, 615, and 620.

- **Insights**:
  - The structure explains the efficiency of AcrB in exporting diverse antibiotics, contributing to *E. coli*'s drug resistance.

## **Key Findings**
1. **Beta-Galactosidase**:
   - Residue distances confirm active site geometry is optimized for catalytic activity.

2. **Multidrug Efflux Pump AcrB**:
   - Structural features reveal how the binding pocket facilitates multidrug resistance.

## **Future Work**
- Extend analysis to additional *E. coli* proteins, such as:
  - Virulence factors (e.g., Hemolysin).
  - DNA replication enzymes (e.g., DNA Gyrase).
- Incorporate molecular docking simulations to explore ligand binding.
