# **Methodology**

## **Project Overview**
This project aims to visualize and analyze *E. coli* protein structures to uncover structural and functional properties. Tools like PyMOL and Biopython are employed for 3D visualization, structural analysis, and reporting.

---

## **Tools and Software**
1. **PyMOL**: Used for 3D visualization of protein structures.
2. **Biopython**: Utilized for computational analysis of protein features such as distances and residue interactions.
3. **Matplotlib**: For graphical representation of data.
4. **RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB)**: Source of protein structure datasets.

## **Steps**

### **1. Dataset Collection**
- Protein structures were selected from the RCSB Protein Data Bank.
- Focus was given to *E. coli* proteins critical for metabolism, virulence, or drug resistance.
- Example proteins included:
  - Beta-Galactosidase (PDB ID: 1JZC)
  - Multidrug Efflux Pump AcrB (PDB ID: 1IWG)

### **2. Visualization**
- PyMOL was used to load and display the protein structures in cartoon representation.
- Specific residues were highlighted for functional insights:
  - Active sites
  - Ligand-binding pockets
- Visualizations were saved as high-resolution PNG files.

### **3. Structural Analysis**
- Biopython was used to calculate distances between specific residues:
  - Example: Alpha Carbon distances between residues in active sites.
- Residue pairs of interest were identified and analyzed for structural relevance.

### **4. Documentation**
- Findings and visualizations were documented for each protein.
- Key steps included:
  - Highlighting functional regions.
  - Reporting calculated structural metrics.
