# Protein Structure Visualization and Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on visualizing and analyzing protein structures to investigate their structural properties and understand their functional significance. By leveraging advanced 3D visualization tools, we explore protein interactions, dynamics, and potential binding sites. Comparative analysis is performed to identify key structural motifs and their roles in biological functions.

## Key Highlights
- Analyzed a dataset of 500 protein models to derive insights into structural properties.
- Used 3D visualization tools to explore protein interactions and dynamics.
- Identified potential binding sites and key structural motifs.
- Conducted comparative analysis to correlate structural motifs with biological functions.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Software:** PyMOL, Chimera
- **Input Files:** Protein structure files (PDB format)

## Getting Started
